# LTC Video Notes

This app does three things:

- Controls cameras or other timecode-sensitive equipment through a linear timecode audio file
- Timestamps notes taken while the linear timecode audio file is playing
- Provides an optional second window experience, which can be used on a connected monitor to display notes like a teleprompter
