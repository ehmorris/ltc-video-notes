# LTC Video Notes

This app does three things:

1. Controls cameras or other timecode-sensitive equipment through a linear timecode audio file
2. Timestamps notes taken while the linear timecode audio file is playing
3. Provides an optional second-window experience, which can be used on a connected monitor to display notes and the time elapsed
